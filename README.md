# MusicSubscription_AWS
This repository contains the complete implementation of a music subscription project using AWS services. 
The project leverages AWS Lambda, API Gateway, S3, and DynamoDB to create a scalable, serverless architecture for managing music subscriptions.

## Key Components:
1. AWS Lambda: Used for executing backend logic in response to events. This includes user authentication, subscription management, and music catalog operations.
2. API Gateway:  Provides a secure and scalable API interface for the frontend to interact with the backend services.
3. S3 Bucket:  Stores music files and other media content securely, ensuring fast and reliable access.
4. DynamoDB:  Serves as the primary database for storing user data, subscription details, and metadata about the music catalog.

## Features:
1. User Authentication: Secure user login and registration processes.
2. Subscription Management: Handles user subscriptions, renewals, and cancellations.
3. Music Catalog: Allows users to browse and stream available music tracks.
4. Scalable Architecture: Utilizes serverless components to ensure scalability and reduce operational overhead.
